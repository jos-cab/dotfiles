# Plugins Configuration

# Load all plugins from the plugins directory
# Plugins are automatically loaded from ~/.config/ranger/plugins/

# Devicons plugin automatically shows emoji icons next to filenames
# Icons are displayed by default in the filename linemode
# No manual activation needed - icons show automatically

# Use 'M' key to cycle through different linemodes:
# - filename (with icons) - default
# - fileinfo - shows file info
# - permissions - shows file permissions
# - mtime - shows modification time
# etc.

# Plugin-specific settings can be added here
# For example, to disable a specific plugin:
# set plugin_name_enabled false
